Burger is an open sourced and community based app for rating and finding tasty hamburgers. Or cheeseburgers.

We're currently getting set up, so please hold on while we get the basics together.

## We love meaty stacks.

We're going to build our app as a web application based on React, Browserify, ES6/7 and all that good stuff. The backend will
be based on Node and other cool technologies. Very excite.
